pdfpres -- KISS version.

History and "Why?"
==================

The original pdfpres grew a lot over time. Featuritis. I didn't realize
this until it was too late. Sorry. I can no longer maintain the old
code because I simply don't have the resources to do so. The branches
"master" (Gtk2 version) and "gtk3" will freeze. Feel free to fork the
old program.

The new pdfpres is supposed to be a minimalistic KISS application that
follows the Unix philosophy. The main design goal is to keep it as
simple and as small as possible. This means it won't be a "typical" GUI
application that just "does everything". I'll only implement features
that I *really* need.

The new pdfpres is released as PIZZA-WARE.


New Architecture
================

pdfpres is now a toolchest that comprises several individual programs.

One of them is showpdf. This tool's job is to display one page of one
PDF file in one window. It will read simple commands on STDIN to
navigate in the PDF file. That's it -- nothing else.

There's going to be a control program (or script). It will start several
instances of showpdf. The control program will accept your commands:
Show next slide, show previous slide and so on.

There's going to be at least one more program: It'll show your notes.
This program will be started by the control program as well. Maybe I'll
also implement a little timer and/or clock just like in the original
pdfpres.

To sum it up, we'll get something like this:


    +-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+    +-------------+
    |   showpdf   |  |   showpdf   |  |   showpdf   |    |   showpdf   |
    | (preview 1) |  | (preview 2) |  | (preview 3) |    | (projector) |

Why is this better than the old pdfpres?

	- Each component will be a simple component that is relatively easy
	  to maintain. No more 2500 lines of C code.
	- Each component will be a one process. This means, we'll
	  automatically benefit from multiprocessor systems (they are
	  ubiquitous today) without having to worry about multithreading!
	- Although showpdf will be a C program, the other components can be
	  shell scripts or whatever. This saves me a hell lot of time.
	- It's a lot easier to customize and extend. Users can even
	  re-implement whole components if they don't like mine.
	- Some components (such as showpdf) may turn out to be universal
	  components that can be used outside of pdfpres.


Downsides?

	- pdfpres no longer arranges the windows for you. Well, it could do
	  so, but I don't intend to implement that as a part of pdfpres.
	  It's your window manager's job now. It's likely that I'm going to
	  add a special layout for the Awesome WM, though -- this will be
	  part of awesome-vain.
	- It may get harder for other users to work with pdfpres. Sorry but
	  I simply can not maintain a full blown GUI application (as pointed
	  out above). A comparison: The old pdfpres was Firefox, the new
	  pdfpres is uzbl. Something like that.
