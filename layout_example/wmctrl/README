If you're using a "primitive" window manager (one that can't be
programmed) you may find it (very) hard to use slinp.

This directory cotnains an example of how to manage the showpdf windows
with any EWMH compliant window manager.

Use "layout" to arrange the windows. "curscreen" is an auxillary
program.

Instead of simply using these scripts, you better read their code to
learn how they work.
