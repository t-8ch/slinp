If you want a quick start, head over to the man page of
\fBprescontrol\fP(1).

\fBppres\fP is supposed to follow the Unix philosophy and to remain as
simple as possible (from a technical point of view). Each component
should be an almost trivial program that is very easy to maintain. The
tools are meant to work together \(em they are not standalone programs.
.P
Only Arch Linux is officially supported as a platform right now.
\fBppres\fP may or may not work on other operating systems.

The following tools are part of \fBppres\fP:

from \fBstdin\fP that allow you to navigate in that file.
.TP
\fBslidenotes\fP(1)
Retrieves notes for a specific slide.
.TP
\fBstopclock\fP(1)
Stopwatch and clock, combined in a simple application. Reads plain text
commands from \fBstdin\fP to control the stopwatch (start, pause,
reset).
